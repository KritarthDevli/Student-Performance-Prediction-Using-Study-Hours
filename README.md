Overview
This major project applies Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to analyze and predict student performance based on study hours per week.
The model is trained on a dataset containing the number of study hours and corresponding final exam scores. Using this trained model, we can estimate a student’s potential score if they study for a certain number of hours.

In addition to model prediction, the project visualizes:
The distribution of student scores.
The regression line showing actual vs. predicted results.

Features
Predicts student final exam scores using Linear Regression.

Visualizes:
Distribution of exam scores.
Model predictions vs. actual results.
Calculates key performance metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared Score (Model Accuracy)
Allows prediction for any user-specified study hour input.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas – For data manipulation.
NumPy – For numerical computations.
Matplotlib – For data visualization.
Scikit-learn – For building and evaluating the regression model.
